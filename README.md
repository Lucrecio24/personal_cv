# Hi :)
My personal Curriculum Vitae. Developed in react with vite on the server side of things, I guess. No clue of what I'm doing, but that's what makes it fun :)

## Installation

1.- ```git clone https://github.com/Lucrecio24/personal_cv awesome_cv_hire_me_lol```

2.- ```cd awesome_cv_hire_me_lol```

3.- ```npm install```

4.- ```npm run dev``` (Personally I host it on another machine so I have to do ```npm run dev -- --host```)
