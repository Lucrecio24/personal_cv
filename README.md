# Hi :)

My personal Curriculum Vitae. Developed in react with vite on the server side of things, I guess. No clue of what I'm doing, but that's what makes it fun :)

## Installation

1.- `git clone https://github.com/Lucrecio24/personal_cv awesome_cv_hire_me_lol`

2.- `cd awesome_cv_hire_me_lol`

3.- `npm install`

4.- `npm run dev`(Note this will start as a host for local network since that is how I use it)
